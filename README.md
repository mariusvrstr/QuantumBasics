# Quantum Basics using Q#
This is a basic project investigating Microsoft QDE (Q# and Simulator)

![Image console applications](https://github.com/mariusvrstr/QuantumBasics/blob/master/images/Excecution.PNG?raw=true)

*Installation*
	• Install the latest version of Visual Studio Community (Can also use VS Code but this example with focus on VS)
	• Install the latest Q# extension for Visual Studio
	• Download and install the latest .Net Core SDK


*Opening or creating your first Q# Project*
	• It will take some time for the project to allow you to build (In the background it is installing the Quantum Simulator)

*Basic Types*
	• Qubit = A quantum bit

*Basic Operators*
	• H = Hadamard operation: Set Qubit to Superposition (Halfway between 0 and 1 - )
	• M = Collapse a Superposition into a base state (Read the value)
	• X = Flip/Toggle the current value
	• Z = ?
  • Reset / ResetAll = All qubits must be reset before being released
